# Welcome to the electron-shadcn Design System

This is the component library for the **electron-shadcn** project.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, this Storybook serves as the central hub for all UI components.

---

### Our Philosophy

We believe in building a design system that is:

- **Accessible**: Components are built with accessibility (a11y) in mind from the start.
- **Consistent**: A unified look and feel across the entire application.
- **Reusable**: A robust set of components that can be composed to build complex UIs quickly.

### How to Use This Storybook

- Use the sidebar to navigate through the available components.
- Each component has its own documentation and interactive controls to explore its different states and variations.
- Check the "Actions" and "Controls" tabs to see component outputs and modify their props.
